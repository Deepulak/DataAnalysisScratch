You can start with the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) wherein you can access datasets
about business, engineering, life sciences, social sciences, and physical sciences.
You can find data about El Nino, social media, handwritten characters,
sensorless drive diagnosis, bank marketing, and more. It’s more than enough to
fill your time for months and years if you get serious on large-scale data
analysis.

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) such as data about Titanic Survival, grocery
shopping, medical diagnosis, historical air quality, Amazon reviews, crime
statistics, and housing prices.
